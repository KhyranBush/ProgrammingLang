***Scala Part 5b***

*Khyran Bush*

What I liked about Scala
* I liked how similar scala was to java
* How easy it was to find documentation 
* How easy it was to implement new things

What I hated about Scala
* It does not have an IDE
* It is hard to run large amounts of code on the online ide but its still better thasn IOs website
* It does not allow do while loops which made it harder

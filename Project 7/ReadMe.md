***Project 7 Closjure and Haskell ***
*Khyran Bush*
What I liked about CLojure
* It was easy to use
* There was information online
* The solutions were fast
what i did not like about clojure
  * some of the functions are not very user friendly
  * It feels clunky
  * Overall I would not want to sue on a daily basis
What I liked about HAskell
* There is a community surrounding it
* There is plenty of documentation
* The language conventions are user friendly
What I do not like about haskell
* No one really uses it in the real world
* It is ahrd to use with other languages
* IT is purely functional 

The best  references i used for both is STACK OVERFLOW!!! 
It gets the job done everytime
